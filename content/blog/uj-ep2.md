>These things affect countless people in a variety of ways. Sharing this story helps us and maybe you. Here is Robin‚Äôs perspective:

The aside picture is from Sunday, 4/21. It was a pretty good start after an eventful Saturday, which really started Friday night. I was on call Friday and Sunday, and I was up with Paul a lot of Saturday. Because of the potent nature of the chemotherapy meds, he had been told to report any new or weird symptoms he had at any moment. He felt a fluttering in his chest with a twinge of pain on Friday night that was very brief. An EKG done was normal, no other symptoms, other than worsening constipation. Saturday morning he started to get pretty uncomfortable in his left lower abdomen presumably because of that, but the stool softeners ordered were starting to do the trick. All that was put on the side burner once he experienced a sharp retrosternal pain that lasted several minutes and eventually moved down the lower border of his left ribs and then went away. Cardiac enzymes were done, and cardiology was consulted for an opinion in intervention. He had no other cardiac symptoms with the transient pain, labs were normal, and his previous MUGA study showed good function. Out of abundance of caution, we decided it may be best to do a CT angiogram (much less invasive and less risky than a heart catheterization), and that got scheduled for Monday (yesterday) morning.

I worked well into Monday morning, and just before 5 AM I went up to Paul‚Äôs room. I didn‚Äôt want to wake him, but I did hope he was already awake so I could kiss him good night in good conscience. Turns out the noise of the door woke him, so everything went my way. üòâ I made it home and laid in bed for a few hours but slept very little.

After some coffee and catching up on a few things, a ‚Äònew test result‚Äô from MyChart notification came. The CT angiogram had been done, but the most concerning thing about it was that free air in the abdomen was seen. He was then sent back to the scanner for an abdominal/pelvic scan, which confirmed the free air along with worsening diverticulitis, all consistent with perforated diverticulitis. Oddly, his belly pain had gotten much better, and he had just bragged to me about his much improved BM (he actually said, ‚ÄúJournal that!‚Äù Bahaha!). Turns out high dose steroids are really good at masking inflammation and its symptoms. So, what was the chest pain all about? In hindsight, he likely felt the pain behind his sternum in the moments after his bowel perforated, the ensuing air bubbles making their way up under his diaphragm causing referred pain in those places. Hindsight is important in order to prevent similar catastrophes in the future, but I wonder if a crystal ball would be more handy?

## Unexpected Adventure

We unfortunately entered a realm I am much more familiar with: surgery. There were no other good options, and it was fairly urgent that Paul have a colon resection and diverting colostomy. That was done late yesterday afternoon. Dr. DeBeltz (surgeon) said the perforated part of the colon was extremely inflamed and stuck to his bladder, but it was fairly limited to that area. Chemo needs to be suspended until he heals up. He was about 80% done with the first round, and Dr. Hannan says he‚Äôll call that good. Round 2 will hopefully start in a few weeks, which only puts him a week behind schedule.

I guess I didn‚Äôt ask if you wanted the good news or the bad news first and just blathered on about the bad. There is some good news...and it‚Äôs pretty good! Paul‚Äôs lymphoma is responding very well to the chemo. The CTs done yesterday show a significant reduction in tumor burden, and that should continue to happen. There is a bad side to that good news, however. Chemotherapy kills all rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells, but also bone marrow cells. His blood counts will expectedly fall during the next several days, which puts him at a humungous risk of infection. In the setting of a freshly resected colon, that is concerning. We don't want him to be admitted for [neutropenic fever](https://www.oncolink.org/cancer-treatment/hospital-helpers/oncologic-emergencies/neutropenic-fever/), a common emergency for cancer patients. He will get a bone marrow boosting shot today to counteract that a bit, and he‚Äôs on a pile of antibiotics.

Paul is very sleepy today, manageably sore, and handsome as ever. As always and in all things your prayers are welcome and encouraged.
