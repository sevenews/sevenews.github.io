>These things affect countless people in a variety of ways. Sharing this story helps us and maybe you. Here is Robin’s perspective:

As you might imagine, Episode 3 was written after a stressful week of Paul being in the hospital after emergency surgery while he was miserable, overwhelmed, and sleep deprived. I was at least the latter. My interpretation of that experience appeared in print as raw, emotional, and dramatic. It initially did not get approval for publication from headquarters, which is ok. We all know as soon as the “share” button is clicked there is no escaping vulnerability. However, after Paul re-read it he feels it’s a fair representation of these moments, even though our perspectives are significantly different.

Here’s the re-cap:

- Paul’s biggest battle post-op was nausea. As soon as possible, he traded a little extra pain for lack of nausea by not pushing his narcotic PCA button. That made a huge difference.
- Before he could go home, a lot of teaching needed to be done about the colostomy and an IV infusion of antibiotic he was going to need to do at home through his port three times a day for at least a week.

- We got all his meds ordered and delivered for infection prophylaxis before leaving.
- Paul was discharged from the hospital on 4/26. I took him straight over to the Cancer Center for a Neulasta injection. This medication counteracts the negative effects of chemo on bone marrow production.
- We arrived home late afternoon to find food had been delivered and more would arrive shortly.
- After a few nights of better sleep, Paul felt much better both physically and mentally. Me, too.

## The New Normal….For Now

I’ve lost track of how often Paul has had blood drawn for labs since coming home, but none of the results have sounded serious alarms, thankfully. He is handling all his new bells and whistles like a pro, and we were just commenting last night how lucky he is to be physically able to take care of everything himself. He still has staples in his incision, but it’s healing well. He felt so good on Wednesday that he hopped on the mower for quite a while! One thing he has admitted being sad about is that using our pool this summer may not be possible. He has been looking into options, though, so we’re not completely writing it off.

The love and support we have felt from friends and family near and far has been tremendous. The Surgery Department at work held a pot luck lunch fundraiser for Paul and one of my partners who is also going through lymphoma treatment. The response was overwhelming. Denny, Paul’s step-dad, brought over a beautiful hand made leather journal his wife Sharon made for Paul. We have been so touched by all the calls, texts, visits, mail, etc., with offers of well wishes and prayers we sense have truly been uttered. Our boys are doing ok, keeping close tabs on Dad like he does on them. Barring any unforeseen issues or healing problems, round two of inpatient chemotherapy will start on May 9.
