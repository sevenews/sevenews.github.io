<p>These things affect countless people in a variety of ways. Sharing this story helps us and maybe you. Here is Robin’s perspective:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s been a long month this week. Monday (4/22) was surgery, post-op day #0 (POD#0). Everything went as well as possible, and Episode 2 concluded with a peacefully resting picture of Paul. POD#1 (Tuesday) was a little less charming, and my partners graciously covered work for me. He was pretty sore, so he used his Fentanyl PCA fairly often, and that made him nauseous. He was also kept on bedrest for the most part and only allowed ice chips. He did stand at bedside a couple of times. Daniel sent a text from his track meet in Fargo in the afternoon while we were standing together looking out the window: “Hey big guy I just threw 180 [javelin] and I thought of you that entire throw so I thank you for helping me with it. I love you.” Since his previous PR was 165, those words more than adequately wrecked us. It was hard to head home that night knowing how very sad he seemed, unable to fathom feeling normal again in those moments. I have the distinct advantage of seeing countless patients thriving on the other side of similar experiences, but it is important to acknowledge the suffering and sit with folks in empathy at this stage. Watching someone I love very much go through this adds a deeper ache knowing only time for healing is going to make it better.</p>

<p>POD#2 started out a bit brighter and ended with a visible light at the end of the tunnel. He got out of bed more, walked a little in his room, and started to eat toast, clear liquids, and accidentally a chocolate pudding that hadn’t been approved yet. No harm, no foul. It was this day that he traded a little more pain for lack of nausea by not pushing his narcotic PCA even once. That made ALL the difference. Also, the pathology came back on the colon resection which had an incidental finding of a fairly large dysplastic polyp. That hunk of junk needed to come out at some point anyway. POD#3 was even better. They removed the foley catheter enabling him to walk the halls and see the dirt storm for miles that day as he peered out the 6th floor windows to the south. I had gone back to work and was on 24 hr call, so I checked in on him briefly but often.</p>

<p>The surgery team had told us on Thursday that Paul would be discharged on Friday. Thank goodness. The hospital is no place for rest — so much beeping, door shutting, yelling from delirious patients, changing IVs, taking vital signs, go-cart races in the halls, and so on. When I arrived in the morning, the discharge planning and instruction-giving was in full swing! Because of the colon abscess/perforation and surgery, Infectious Disease wanted him to go home on a Zosyn (antibiotic) infusion. This involves starting a 30-45 minute infusion through his port every 8 hours for seven days. The Infusion Center nurse was there just starting the instructions, so I was able to sit in on them. There are a lot of steps that need to be taken to maintain sterility, and most of the concepts were brand new to him. He became a pro almost instantly! He initially confused the word <em>flush</em> in ‘saline flush’ with <em>backwash</em>, but if the results are the same, who cares what he calls it.</p>
<p>After the infusion nurse was done, the colostomy care team came for some intense teaching. For a lot of reasons, we just wanted to get this process nailed down, but in the setting of probable neutropenia and intra-peritoneal infection we know it’s crucial. They were really good and sent us home with everything we need.</p>

<p>As they were finishing up, Paul was standing there with us three women in just his underwear, port accessed, freshly changed colostomy appliance and bag when a friend came to the hospital room door unexpectedly. I gave him a ‘just a second’ nod and told Paul that he was outside. Paul hollered, “Might as well come in!” It was then that I realized the threshold between <em>my private body and life</em> and <em>I am willing to accept any help and encouragement</em> had been crossed. The look of compassion on our friend’s face as he described how he helped his own mother with her colostomy often before she died was priceless. And so relevant. And timely.</p>

<p>As suggested in the title, everything was in working order to allow a safe discharge from the hospital. We had to gather seven different prescriptions for antibiotic, anti-fungal, and antiviral prophylaxis along with his normal blood pressure and cholesterol medications. The pharmacy tech delivered them to Paul’s room and required the $8 not covered by insurance. My credit card wouldn’t work on the scanner, but Dr. DeBeltz (surgeon) happened to come in at that time and spotted us a $10 bill. Done deal. We packed everything that had accumulated in his room and rolled it down to the car on a cart while an aid pushed Paul in a wheelchair to my front passenger side door. We may be allergic to gratitude, relief, and/or being overwhelmed, because they made our eyes water.</p>

<p>From there we headed to the Cancer Center for a bone marrow boosting shot (Neulasta) that had been put on hold with the whole surgery kerfuffle. They wanted him to have it before the weekend. He had to sit there for 15 minutes after the shot no make sure he didn’t have a bad reaction, and then we went home. Home! Sweet! Home! After a couple much better nights of sleep, he is looking and feeling pretty well. He still has staples in his midline incision that bite once in awhile and some achy-ness from the Neulasta but nothing over-the-counter meds can’t handle.</p>
<p>Next round of chemo is tentatively scheduled for May 9, but that all depends on how he is healing and his labs. He will have labs drawn often until then, and he’ll continue antibiotics/antivirals/anti-fungals for about another week. We do hope and pray for an uneventful new normal until we can return to our uneventful old normal. We have appreciated your prayers, texts, calls, fan mail, gifts, and visits more than we can express.</p>
