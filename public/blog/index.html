<p>It’s been a long month this week. Monday (4/22) was surgery, post-op day #0 (POD#0). Everything went as well as possible, and Episode 2 concluded with a peacefully resting picture of Paul. POD#1 (Tuesday) was a little less charming, and my partners graciously covered work for me. He was pretty sore, so he used his Fentanyl PCA fairly often, and that made him nauseous. He was also kept on bedrest for the most part and only allowed ice chips. He did stand at bedside a couple of times. Daniel sent a text from his track meet in Fargo in the afternoon while we were standing together looking out the window: “Hey big guy I just threw 180 [javelin] and I thought of you that entire throw so I thank you for helping me with it. I love you.” Since his previous PR was 165, those words more than adequately wrecked us. It was hard to head home that night knowing how very sad he seemed, unable to fathom feeling normal again in those moments. I have the distinct advantage of seeing countless patients thriving on the other side of similar experiences, but it is important to acknowledge the suffering and sit with folks in empathy at this stage. Watching someone I love very much go through this adds a deeper ache knowing only time for healing is going to make it better.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/uj-ep3/">Read more...</a></span>

<p>The aside picture is from Sunday, 4/21. It was a pretty good start after an eventful Saturday, which really started Friday night. I was on call Friday and Sunday, and I was up with Paul a lot of Saturday. Because of the potent nature of the chemotherapy meds, he had been told to report any new or weird symptoms he had at any moment. He felt a fluttering in his chest with a twinge of pain on Friday night that was very brief. An EKG done was normal, no other symptoms, other than worsening constipation. Saturday morning he started to get pretty uncomfortable in his left lower abdomen presumably because of that, but the stool softeners ordered were starting to do the trick. All that was put on the side burner once he experienced a sharp retrosternal pain that lasted several minutes and eventually moved down the lower border of his left ribs and then went away. Cardiac enzymes were done, and cardiology was consulted for an opinion in intervention. He had no other cardiac symptoms with the transient pain, labs were normal, and his previous MUGA study showed good function. Out of abundance of caution, we decided it may be best to do a CT angiogram (much less invasive and less risky than a heart catheterization), and that got scheduled for Monday (yesterday) morning.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/uj-ep2/">Read more...</a></span>

<p>Exactly one month ago today, barely a day after Paul and Noah returned from an epic trip to Seoul to visit Josh and Aurelie, Paul asked, “Will you feel my belly?” Fast forward to today, the first day of chemotherapy (RCHOP) for an aggressive large B-cell “double hit” lymphoma that has recently transformed from a low grade follicular lymphoma he has had for who knows how long. As the news of this challenge is trickling beyond our immediate circle, I thought it would be best to consolidate information and experiences here. Keep in mind that this is all from my perspective, the primary support and advocate. Paul’s perspective will be different and far more enlightening and interesting, and I’m looking forward to seeing this experience through his eyes, too.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/uj-ep1/">Read more...</a></span>
