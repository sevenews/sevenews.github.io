<blockquote>
<p>These things affect countless people in a variety of ways. Sharing this story helps us and maybe you. Here is Robin&rsquo;s perspective:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly one month ago today, barely a day after Paul and Noah returned from an epic trip to Seoul to visit Josh and Aurelie, Paul asked, “Will you feel my belly?” Fast forward to today, the first day of chemotherapy (RCHOP) for an aggressive large B-cell “double hit” lymphoma that has recently transformed from a low grade follicular lymphoma he has had for who knows how long. As the news of this challenge is trickling beyond our immediate circle, I thought it would be best to consolidate information and experiences here. Keep in mind that this is all from my perspective, the primary support and advocate. Paul’s perspective will be different and far more enlightening and interesting, and I’m looking forward to seeing this experience through his eyes, too.</p>
<p>So, how did we get here?</p>
<p>Usually, in many situations, there are clues seen in retrospect. Paul’s oncologist, Dr. Hannan, feels that Paul may have had a low grade lymphoma for a year or two before it transformed into this high grade lymphoma. Could vague complaints of aches and pains over the years have been a clue? Paul often attributed all that to being fifty years old, and since he’s had six more years of experience with that affliction, I really had no reason to argue or be very concerned. His activities of daily living didn’t suffer, and his disposition has always been annoyingly steady. So, should we have seen this coming? We don’t think so. I feel pretty confident that it has truly come out of the blue. In fact, if Paul hadn’t been as in tune with his own body as he is, he could have easily brushed off the bump he noticed in his belly until it would not be ignored. We are glad to be in the treatment phase now instead of approaching a diagnosis and being that much more behind the eight ball.</p>
<h4 id="sequence-of-events">Sequence of events:</h4>
<p>Paul and Noah travel to Seoul from March 6-17. During the trip, Paul feels his belly, somewhat regretting the rich, later evening meals they have been having. Something’s not quite right. On Monday, March 18, Paul asked me to feel what he was feeling. We immediately sent a note to his primary care doctor suggesting he get some imaging done. He saw Dr. Chan the next day, and an ultrasound was ordered for the day after that. A pretty large mesenteric mass (8.2 x 7.9 x 4.8 cm) was noted on that exam (3/20). An abdominal/pelvic CT scan was ordered for the next day which showed a “large, bulky central mesenteric mass measuring roughly 80.4 x 37.5 x 74.1 mm.” It also showed extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy, all these things favoring lymphoma. Biopsy of the mesenteric mass was scheduled for the next day (3/22) under general anesthesia. That was week number 1.</p>

<p>Initial pathology was done here at Altru, but the sample was sent to Mayo Clinic for final pathology and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (flashback to biochemistry). In the mean time, we met with Dr. Hannan, an oncologist here at Altru, upon the recommendation of Dr. Smith, the interventional radiologist who did Paul’s biopsy, that next Tuesday (3/26). He proceeded to order the tests necessary to complete the work-up, which included a bone marrow biopsy and a PET scan. We also wanted to get his recommendation about going on a trip to Florida we had planned for March 30-April 6. He said, “Go. The studies won’t be resulted for a few weeks anyway.” Dr. Smith did the bone marrow biopsy the next day (3/27). PET scan was scheduled for 4/9 when we got back from Florida.</p>
<p>We spent a glorious week in Cocoa Beach. Dr. Hannan had told us during the initial visit that he was pretty confident this was a low grade follicular lymphoma, because of how asymptomatic Paul was (no fevers, night sweats, weight loss, etc.). We enjoyed moments of forgetting about it while listening to the sounds of the ocean and feeling the warmth of the sun. Paul’s sister, Amy, drove over from the gulf side to spend a day and night with us, we discovered eating out is so much cheaper with only two people, and March Madness did not disappoint.</p>
<p>The final pathology report came back on Friday, April 5: “High- grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements, arising in follicular lymphoma.” Ok. We assumed at this point there would be chemo. We sent a note to Dr. Hannan telling him we had seen the report and wondered if that would change the follow-up appointment he had scheduled for 4/18. We received a message back that weekend that he would see Paul on 4/11 instead.</p>
<p>Paul reported for his PET scan on 4/9, but the scanner wouldn’t boot up. He was rescheduled for 4/12. We saw Dr. Hannan on 4/11, and his tone and projected urgency had changed dramatically from the first appointment in light of the final diagnosis. He assured Paul that he needed aggressive chemotherapy to treat this aggressive lymphoma. Ok, let’s go! He offered to refer us to Mayo but cautioned that they would want to enroll him in a study, which would mean a delay in starting treatment. He sternly advised against that. He did consult with other colleagues who have agreed his plan of attack is the best, and he is double-checking with Mayo via an e-consult to make sure he’s not missing anything. The next step was scheduling a MUGA scan and getting Paul on the schedule for chemo.</p>
<p>During the chemo conversation, which included a description of the medications, side effects, number of rounds, etc., Dr. Hannan said Paul would need to be in the hospital for his treatment. We both heard “24 hour infusion,” thinking it would be an over night stay. As we were clarifying a few things with him, he realized that we didn’t quite catch the fact that Paul would be in the hospital for five straight days at a time for treatment, not just one whole day. Wow. I haven’t seen or taken care of an inpatient chemo patient since I was on ICU during residency, so that was not on my radar. Dr. Hannan apologetically acknowledged our surprise and continued the explanation of six rounds of chemo, each round taking five days as an inpatient, every three weeks. Aggressive = buckle up, buttercup.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a logistical challenge to make sure there is certified nursing staff available to take care of inpatient chemo patients five days in a row. Dr. Hannan told us Monday - Friday usually works best, and since there were a few things left for Paul to do before he started, he estimated an April 22 start. It was at this visit Dr. Hannan noticed Paul’s abdomen had gotten bigger since the first time he saw him, which we had also noticed. We were all clearly ready to get treatment started ASAP.</p>
<p>Next on the list was to get the PET scan done that had been postponed earlier in the week. That was done on 4/12, and the results weren’t too surprising: “Lymphoma with hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy involving the supraclavicular regions, mediastinum, mesentery, retroperitoneum.” We knew about the abdomen from the CT, and this test showed disease above his clavicles as well. Lymph nodes are everywhere, folks.</p>
<p>That afternoon Paul had a port placed by Dr. Smith in interventional radiology. Daniel and I were at MSUM for a football recruiting event he had been planning on for a long time, so Nancy came to the rescue and brought Paul to and from that procedure. It was a busy, busy day, but all went well. Paul’s sister, Barb, made the trip up on Friday as well, and stayed a few days with us! His brother, Tim, came up the next day and Sunday, and the two of them helped Paul with a bunch of outside odds and ends while I was working. That was a tremendous help, and they really enjoyed working together.</p>
<p>Next on the list was the MUGA scan, which is just a formality to make sure Paul’s heart will be able to tolerate chemotherapy. That was done on Monday, 4/15. His heart was perfect. No surprises. Later that day we got a message from the Cancer Center staff saying they had the MUGA results and would like him to start chemo on Thursday, 4/18! Deal. Whew. Enough talk. Let’s fight!</p>
<p>We spent the next couple of days just being together, running errands, buying shoes…..you know, the kind of stuff old married people do. One very special thing we did was go visit Paul’s step- dad in Bagley, Denny. He has had is own health battles, and he really wanted to see Paul before he got up to his eyeballs in alligators with treatment. We had lunch with him and Sharon, caught up on a few things, and just enjoyed being with each other.</p>
<p>So, exactly one month ago we embarked on a very unexpected journey.</p>
